PUSH_SWAP

The push_swap project encompasses a number of operations to organize a given pile composed of a random number of random integer values. It does so by manipulating two linked lists that behave as if they were piles. 

The program analises each node in said lists and juggles them out between the two piles by using a number of pre-vetted operations until it sorts out the piles in a specific fashion: from lowest to biggest value.
